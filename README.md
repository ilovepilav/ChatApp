## Installation

You need to publish ChatApp.Web and MessageConsumer layers separately. Use your own database connection string and RabbitMQ hostname where they needed.

## Usage

Just run the application after cloning into Visual Studio or Rider, if you're using VS Code you need to run Web and MessageConsumer individually because MessageConsumer layer is a console application.
